# 🧠 NeuroSync

> **"Plug your resume into the neural grid."**  
> An AI-powered personal chatbot that answers questions about your experience, education, and skills — like it *knows* you.

## 🚀 Overview

**NeuroSync** transforms your resume into an intelligent, interactive chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-4 and LangChain. Instead of just reading your CV, users can now ask questions like:

- "What programming languages do I know?"
- "Summarize my work experience."
- "What are my strengths from past projects?"

Whether you're a job seeker, recruiter, or tech enthusiast, NeuroSync is your next-gen resume interface.

## 🧠 How It Works

NeuroSync:
1. Loads your resume (PDF)
2. Breaks it into intelligent chunks
3. Embeds it into a vector database
4. Uses GPT-4 to retrieve and answer any question based on that data

All locally. All yours. No cloud storage. No compromise.
